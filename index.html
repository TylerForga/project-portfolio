                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am currently in school learning to become a software developer but the scope of my learning extends beyond
                        the classroom and into exploring technologies on my own leisure. My current skillset consists of: 
                        <br/>Markup languages- HTML5 and CSS3
                        <br/>Programming languages- Javascript, Java, C#, and PHP
                        <br/>Frameworks- .NET, Bootstrap, and jQuery
                        <br/>Databases- mySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Access
                        <br/>Tools- IDEs (VS Code, Visual Studio 2019, Eclipse) and Database Tools (phpMyAdmin)
                        <br/>Version Control- Git, GitHub, Bitbucket
                        <br/>
                        I have a strong understanding of Object Orientated Programming and the Software Development Life Cycle, and book 
                        knowledge about traditional and Agile methodologies such as the Waterfall Model and Scrum. I am familiar with 
                        the Model-View-Controller architectural design pattern.
                        In addition to my current college courses' cirrculum, my future learning will consist of adding frameworks of 
                        JavaScript to my skillset. The next immediate frameworks I plan on studying are React.js, Node.js, and Jest. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While I don't have any professional experience to show yet, I have been working on personal projects outside of 
                        school projects. I have created a desktop application called Concert Tracker and a website called Workout Tracker. 
                        I will be adding on to each as well as creating new websites and applications to showcase 
                        my knowledge. You can view these projects and follow along with my progression and future plans for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of my learning endeavors and project work, I enjoy quality time with family and friends. My interests 
                        include outdoor activities like hiking, fishing, and hunting as well as daily activities such as working out 
                        and reading about new and upcoming technologies. Not only do I enjoy researching new and upcoming technologies, 
                        I believe it's essential for professionals in the software industry to do so.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Workout and Macros Tracker Website</h2>
                    <p>
                        This website contains a Homepage, a Workout page, a Tracker page for workouts and macros, and an About page. 
                        This website uses HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. It's fully responsive, has CSS animations, and contains dynamic content.  
                        I chose GitHub pages as my webhost, but they only allow static content so I couldn't integrate a database. The way I could 
                        include dynamic content is by utilizing session storage which works in GitHub pages. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Homepage consists of information about the site and picture columns. Under a width of 940 pixels, the picture columns
                        turn to individual pictures that rotate through all the pictures at a 5 second interval. Currently when you resize the 
                        page in the browser developer tool, it will show all 5 pictures and you will need to refresh the page in order for it 
                        to work. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Workouts page consists of a form that allows users to search and filter exercises. Right now for visual demonstration purposes only, 
                        the workouts are hard coded in so functionality of the form does not work right now. Until I integrate a database, it will be 
                        non-functional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Macro & Workout Tracker page consists of instructions on how to use the form, a form, and a dynamic calendar. Upon submitting a 
                        entry in the form, it will alter the background color of the cell in the calendar for the date you created an entry for. Clicking 
                        the cell will output all the entries for that date underneath the calendar. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The About page consists of information about the creation of the website, a little bit about me, and a questions, comments, and 
                        concerns form for users to submit entries to me. Until I integrate a database, it is non-functional and for visual demonstration 
                        purposes only.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Future plans for this website is to integrate a database and user accounts. Doing so will allow users to be able to 
                        save their entries, add their own workouts and share workouts with other users. It will also allow me to add 
                        functionality to search and filter exercises on the Workouts page, as well as add functionality to the questions, 
                        comments, or concerns form under the About page.

                        <p>
                            The Concert Tracker App was created using the .NET framework of C# in Visual Studio. This application allows users
                            to search concerts or events provided by Ticketmaster. Users can search by the name of an event or artist, 
                            the name of a venue, the genre of the music, and/or the state. This application uses 3 different endpoints 
                            under Ticketmaster's Discovery API such as the Event Search endpoint, the Venue Search endpoint, and the Classification 
                            endpoint. The reason for this is because their Event Search endpoint doesn't support query parameters such as a 
                            venue name or genre name but does support query parameters such as venue ids and genre ids. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Clicking Search will open a new window with data based on the search criteria. An example output is shown 
                            (click to view it fullscreen) with the search criteria of country for the music genre and MN for the state. The table will show data for 
                            the event name, the venue name, the state, the date of the event, the cheapest price and most expensive price 
                            for a ticket, a link to purchase the tickets (double click to open), and a save button (for a future release).

                        Future updates for this application include integration of a database to be able to store and save concerts.
                        This will include a price analysis for each concert as well. A help menu item will also be added to further 
                        explain the application or answer common questions.
